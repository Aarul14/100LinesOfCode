#### Description

Practical way to use objects in Javascript. I have created a form that takes data on a book to submit 
This book object has values stored for the title, author, and isbn number. While the ui class handles 
any changes to be made on the UI

#### How to use

cd into the folder booklist, and then open the folder in vscode. If you have liveserver installed when 
you left click on the index.html file it would ask you to open with liveserver which would then open the page 
up on the browser.
